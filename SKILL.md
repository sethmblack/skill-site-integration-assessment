# Site Integration Assessment

Evaluate how well a design integrates with its context and recommend improvements for achieving organic fit—where design and site enhance each other.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether a design "belongs" to its location
- Reviewing proposals that seem disconnected from context
- Request for "site integration" evaluation
- Design feels imposed rather than grown from conditions
- Need to strengthen relationship between creation and context

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| design | Yes | The design, product, or proposal being evaluated |
| site | Yes | Description of the site, context, or environment |
| relationship | No | Current relationship between design and site |
| goals | No | What the integration should achieve |

---

## The Assessment Framework

### Part 1: Site Understanding

Before evaluating integration, fully understand the site:

**Physical Factors:**
- Topography: slopes, elevations, natural landforms
- Orientation: sun path, prevailing winds, views
- Climate: temperature, precipitation, seasonal variation
- Natural features: water, vegetation, rock formations

**Cultural Factors:**
- Neighborhood character and architectural language
- Historical context and precedent
- Community values and expectations
- Regulatory and zoning constraints

**Experiential Factors:**
- How people approach and encounter the site
- Existing rhythms of use and movement
- Sound environment—what you hear
- Light quality throughout the day

### Part 2: Design Evaluation

Assess the design against site conditions:

**Relationship to Ground:**
- Does it sit on the land or belong to it?
- How does it meet the earth—heavy or light?
- Does it follow natural contours or impose geometry?

**Relationship to Climate:**
- Does it respond to sun path and orientation?
- Does it address wind, rain, temperature?
- Does it work with seasons or ignore them?

**Relationship to Views:**
- Does it capture meaningful views?
- Does it screen undesirable views?
- Does it create new views worth having?

**Relationship to Neighbors:**
- Does it converse with surrounding structures?
- Does it respect existing scale and rhythm?
- Does it contribute to or detract from context?

**Material Relationship:**
- Are materials appropriate to place?
- Do colors relate to natural surroundings?
- Is there dialogue between built and natural materials?

### Part 3: Integration Scoring

Rate integration on Wright's principle: "The good building is not one that hurts the landscape, but one which makes the landscape more beautiful than it was before."

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 - Hostile | Design damages or ignores site; landscape worse for it |
| 2 - Indifferent | Design could be anywhere; no relationship to place |
| 3 - Respectful | Design acknowledges site but doesn't fully integrate |
| 4 - Integrated | Design responds to and works with site conditions |
| 5 - Organic | Design and site enhance each other; inseparable whole |

### Part 4: Recommendations

For each disconnect, provide specific recommendations:
- What changes would improve integration?
- What site features deserve stronger response?
- What design elements fight the site?
- How could the design make the site more beautiful?

## Constraints

- Do not evaluate design in isolation—always in relation to site
- Do not assume any site is a blank slate
- Do not privilege design over site or site over design
- The goal is mutual enhancement, not dominance
- Consider integration across seasons and times of day

## Example

**Input:** "Evaluate this proposal: a modern glass box office building on a wooded hillside site with mature oak trees."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Site Integration Assessment

### Site Understanding

**Physical Conditions:**
| Factor | Observation | Significance |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Topography | Hillside with natural slope | Building should step with slope, not level it |
| Orientation | South-facing slope | Solar opportunity but also solar challenge for glass |
| Climate | Four-season region | Glass will overheat summer, lose heat winter |
| Natural features | Mature oak grove | Trees are the site's defining character |

**Cultural Context:**
| Factor | Observation | Significance |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Neighborhood | Wooded residential edge | Industrial aesthetic will clash |
| History | Former agricultural land | Memory of landscape, not urban |
| Community | Values natural character | Glass box signals urban intrusion |

**Experiential Qualities:**
- Approach: Winding road through trees; arrival should feel like emergence
- Sound: Bird song, wind through leaves; building should not introduce mechanical drone
- Light: Dappled through canopy; direct sun only in clearings

### Integration Evaluation

| Relationship | Current State | Assessment |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| To ground | Flat platform cut into hillside | 2 - Indifferent |
| To climate | Glass ignores thermal challenges | 1 - Hostile |
| To views | Captures woods but exposes all equally | 3 - Respectful |
| To neighbors | Alien vocabulary to context | 2 - Indifferent |
| To materials | Glass/steel versus organic woodland | 2 - Indifferent |

**Overall Integration Score:** 2/5
**Assessment:** Indifferent—design could be placed anywhere; no relationship to this specific site.

### Key Disconnects

1. **Platform vs. Slope:** Cutting a flat platform into the hillside destroys the topography the site offers. The building sits ON the hill, not OF the hill.

2. **Glass vs. Forest:** The all-glass envelope creates thermal problems (summer overheating, winter heat loss) and offers no dialogue with the organic materials surrounding it.

3. **Box vs. Organic Form:** The rectilinear geometry imposes urban formality on an organic woodland setting.

4. **Exposure vs. Selective Framing:** Equal transparency everywhere fails to curate views—the beautiful oak to the south matters more than the parking lot to the north.

### Recommendations

**Priority Changes:**

1. **Step the building with the slope:** Multiple levels following terrain, not single platform. Let the building cascade down the hill as the land does.

2. **Reduce and concentrate glass:** Use glass strategically for key views; introduce solid walls with natural materials (stone, wood) for thermal mass and dialogue with forest.

3. **Add substantial overhangs:** Deep roof projections provide passive solar control and connect building to tree canopy through horizontal emphasis.

4. **Integrate tree preservation into design:** Let the best oaks penetrate the building envelope through courtyards or preserved groves; make trees part of the architecture.

**Site Features Deserving Response:**
- The mature oaks: Should be celebrated, not merely preserved—visible from interior, framing key views
- The slope: Building's section should reveal the hillside experience
- The dappled light: Interior should capture this quality through filtered skylights or tree-screen

**Design Elements to Reconsider:**
- The flat glass curtain wall: Offers no response to orientation, climate, or material context
- The single-floor-plate concept: Ignores the gift of topographic variety
- The plaza entry: Imposes urban gesture on woodland approach

### Organic Vision

Imagine instead: a building that steps down the hillside, its levels following the natural contours, stone walls rising from the slope's own rock. Roof planes extend outward like tree branches, providing shade in summer, admitting low winter sun. Glass opens to the south where the finest oaks stand, their trunks framed as living columns. The approach through the grove reveals the building gradually, emerging from the trees rather than confronting them. Inside, dappled light through clerestories recalls the forest canopy. The building and the woodland enhance each other—each more beautiful for the presence of the other.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Frank Lloyd Wright** expert persona. Use it when evaluating whether designs belong to their contexts or merely occupy them.
